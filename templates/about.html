<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
  when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an
  adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo
  to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
  force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the
      mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other
      Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in
      TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This
      was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA
      2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
      Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken
      tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

    <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set
      out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo
      Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Fíli and
      Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from
      Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual"
      characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who
      were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
      in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941
      joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
      would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his
      brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the
      Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and
      later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The
      Company of Thorin.

    <h3>Gloin</h3>
    <p>
      Glóin son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's
      company who set out to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor.
      He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of
      the Ring. Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character.
      Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring during the Fellowship's
      stay in Rivendell.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin.
      He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield
      on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord known for his
      wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
      friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant
      of the noble house of Durin. He later went to re-establish the kingdom of
      Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was
      killed there along with the rest of his companions.

    <h3>Dori</h3>
    <p>
      Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and
      cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a
      member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely
      Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who
      joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as
      well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent
      fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on
      the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the
      thirteen companions.[2]

    <h3>Bifur</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of
      Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is
      known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out
      of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced
      to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following
      Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued
      his life as a toy maker.

      Bofur was a Dwarf of the late-Third Age. He is best known for being
      companions to Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf on the quest
      to reclaim Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his brother
      Bombur and cousin Bifur.

    <h3>Bombur</h3>
    <p>
      Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of
      Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the
      Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
      between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest
      of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured,
      Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born
      in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior
      to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside
      Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>
      Gandalf tengwar "He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a
      silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out
      beyond the brim of his hat." —The Fellowship of the Ring, "A Long-expected
      Party" Gandalf (Norse; IPA: [gand:alf] - "Elf of the Wand" or "Wand-elf")
      the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin
      (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin] - "Dreamer" or "Of Dreams"), was an Istar
      (Wizard), sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of
      Sauron. He joined Thorin and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
      from Smaug, convoked the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring,
      and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
